### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alana.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying CS and math. Recently, I've been doing lots of statistics and combinatorics. I'm also playing around with Javascript and OpenCV.
- ðŸ”­ How can we translate recent advances in network and graph-based note-taking systems to social media? I'm doing exploratory work on a program that will probably look a lot like [Glue](https://a9.io/glue-comic/).
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about how we can help humanity build safe, aligned, and powerful AI systems.

Unfortunately, most of my recent projects have not been public. Here's what *is* in this repository:

- Last summer, as a Google Summer of Code student, I was able [improve DeepChem's burgeoning support](https://forum.deepchem.io/t/google-summer-of-code-2021-large-scale-protein-modeling-in-deepchem/507/2) for large-scale biological modeling. I've been working on DeepChem for quite a while now, and you will be able to find most of the code I've written in DeepChem here.
- Two years ago, I wrote a toy program called PyITA: **P**ython **I**mplementation of **T**aylor Expansion for **A**ENet as a gigantic [yak-shave](https://sketchplanations.com/yak-shaving). PyITA allows users to apply the Cooper, KÃ¤stner, Urban, and Artrith Taylor expansion-based data augmentation method to increase training accuracy. While I still think PyITA was quite an interesting project, I've learned a lot about the importance of writing maintainable, clean code since then. Unfortunately, I have to recommend against using PyITA in any production environment.

Feel free to raise an Issue in this repository, or message me anywhere else, if you'd like to get in touch!
