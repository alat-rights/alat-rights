### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**alat-rights/alat-rights** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

My name is Alana.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying CS and math. Recently, I've been doing lots of statistics and combinatorics. I've also been playing with tools such as Javascript and OpenCV.
- ðŸ”­ I'm obsessed with the idea of translating recent advances network and graph-based note-taking systems to social media. I'm doing exploratory work on something that might look a lot like [Glue](https://a9.io/glue-comic/).
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about how we can help humanity build safe, aligned, and powerful AI systems.

Unfortunately, most of my recent projects have not been public. 

Here's what is in this repository:

- Last summer, as a Google Summer of Code student, I was able [expand DeepChem's burgeoning support](https://forum.deepchem.io/t/google-summer-of-code-2021-large-scale-protein-modeling-in-deepchem/507/2) for large-scale biological modeling. I've been working with DeepChem for quite a while now, and you will be able to find most of the code I wrote for DeepChem on this profile.
- Two years ago, I wrote a toy program called PyITA: **P**ython **I**mplementation of **T**aylor Expansion for **A**ENet as a gigantic [yak-shave](https://sketchplanations.com/yak-shaving). PyITA allows users to apply the Cooper, KÃ¤stner, Urban, and Artrith's Taylor expansion-based data augmentation method to increase training accuracy. While I still think PyITA was quite an interesting project, I've learned a lot about the importance of writing maintainable, clean code it was written. I can't quite recommend you to use the code in a production environment.

Feel free to raise an Issue in this repository or message me anywhere else if you'd like to get in touch!
