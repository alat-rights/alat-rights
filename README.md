### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alana.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently studying CS and math. Recently, I've been doing lots of statistics and combinatorics. I'm also playing around with Javascript and OpenCV.
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about how we can build safe, aligned, and powerful AI systems to help humanity.

Unfortunately, most of my recent projects have not been public.

Feel free to raise an Issue in this repository, or message me anywhere else, if you'd like to get in touch!
